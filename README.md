# Personal Vault Project PVP[^1]

ðŸ˜Œ Imagine having all your digital life, in your possession, indexed and searchable.
ðŸ¤– Now, add AI on top and be able to ask it anything about your life. Find trends, detect habits, find the bright and the dark spots.
ðŸ§³ Your digital legacy, completely yours. All your photos, notes, posts, projects, chats, everything.
âœ¨ This is a project I've been pondering for a while now, but actually giving it more thought now. I finally have words on paper.

See the [Discussions section](https://github.com/dlucian/pvp/discussions) to ask, comment, suggest or contribute.

## Development

Ensure you have a `.env` file. Start the system:

```shell
./start.sh
```

This will launch the containers, and start the watch service on the vault folder.

Once the system is started, you can check it up by:

- adding/updating/removing files in the `vault` directory
- checking the database via PgAdmin at http://localhost:5050/
- tail the logs with `tail -f ./roadrunner/logs/app.log`

If you want to manually start/stop the system:

```shell
# Destroy all conainers + volumes and rebuild from scratch
docker compose down -v && docker compose up --build

# Destroy all conainers and rebuild from scratch
docker compose down && docker compose up --build

# Run the scan script
docker compose exec --workdir /var/www roadrunner /bin/bash -c "php src/scan.php"
```

Run the tests:

```shell
docker compose exec --workdir /var/www roadrunner /bin/bash -c "vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox"
```

Watch and send:

```
fswatch -0 --event Created --event Updated --event Renamed --event Removed ./vault | xargs -0 -n 1 -I {} ./path-converter.sh {}
```
