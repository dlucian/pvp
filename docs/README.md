## Building and previewing the docs site locally

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.

## Publishing your built site on a different platform

Just upload all the files in the directory `_site`.

## Customization

You're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like!

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.
