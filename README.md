## Building and previewing your site locally

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.

## Publishing your built site on a different platform

Just upload all the files in the directory `_site`.
